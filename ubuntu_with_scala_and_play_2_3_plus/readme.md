To run this dev environment you will need to install vagrant and virtualbox. Once done, run "vagrant up; 
vagrant ss" and the machine will be created and then provisioned by puppet for you.

Once the machine is ready you can use the "activator" command to create new scala projects. For more 
information on activator, the official docs are the best place: https://typesafe.com/activator.

Activator wraps the SBT build tool.
